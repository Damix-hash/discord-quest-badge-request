# discord-quest-badge-request
Fetch/Request to get the newest "Completed Quest" discord icon/badge.
Requires: Token, Captcha Key and Captcha RqToken
I did it purely for the people that are interested in headers/data that come with it
If you get captcha key and captcha request token you can instantly get newest badge blah blah do whatever you want with the code!
